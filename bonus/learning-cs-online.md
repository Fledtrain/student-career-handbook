# Learning Computer Science

### Getting Started

* Start with the [free Harvard CS50 course on EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science). Check out the sub [r/cs50](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50) has a lot of like minded people learning together.
* [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science): _This is a solid path for those of you who want to complete a Computer Science course on your own time, for free, with courses from the best universities in the World._
* Learn Java OOP \(here is an excellent course\): [Java MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

### Web Development

* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) for web development
* [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) has a good web dev course and is highly recommended to do in parallel with freecodecamp
