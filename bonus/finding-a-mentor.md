# Guide to Finding a Mentor

We all know it’s smart to think proactively about finding mentors because the right people in your corner can really accelerate your growth.

One of the most impactful mentors is one that’s in the company that you work at, and Nick Caldwell \(former CTO of Reddit\) has an interesting take on thinking about mentorship vs sponsorship:
