### How can I build up my programming fundamentals in Java?

Chances are that you will be introduced to Java, Python, Lisp, and/or C++ in school at various points over your 4-years in college. Often, you might take a 101 intro class that starts you off with one of these languages. If you feel that your understanding of Java or other languages is lacking, this is nothing to be worried about, it’s very common for you to need to reinforce the concepts learned in class through additional online resources before having a deeper understanding. If you are interested in diving deeper with Java, check out our [Diving Deeper with Java](../../domain-specific/a-deeper-understanding-of-java.md) resources for a good place to start.

### Before graduating college, how important is your GPA as opposed to side projects in acquiring your first internship?

If you have a strong GPA, make sure to list that on your resume. Include the higher of your cumulative GPA and your major GPA. If they’re both less than 3.5, leave them off your resume entirely.

The importance of GPA depends on the company. Generally speaking, even if you don’t include your GPA on your resume, this will not be asked about and won’t prevent you getting an interview. Having side projects, hackathons, and other interesting real-world portfolio pieces will often provide you more impact in many cases than a high GPA. Of course, your mileage may vary and it never hurts to get good grades.

### Does it matter to companies if your CS Degree is a BA or a BS? Does it have any impact at all? And also what about a BA/MA and not a BS/MS?

If you can pick and have the option, you may want to go with the BS. But for the most part, a computer science degree is a computer science degree and many companies/recruiters won’t differentiate. Some employers favor a BS degree because it is often more difficult and requires higher level math and sciences. **Bottom line is that you will be able to find great technical software engineering opportunities either way.**

### I’m studying something other than Computer Science, but I enjoy software stuff. How likely is it for non-traditional majors to slide into software roles?

[“Software is eating the world”](https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). There is software powering every other modern professions. In addition, more and more companies are open to hiring STEM majors who are not Computer Science majors, especially if you have side projects and a Github profile. **In this case, your project portfolio is even more important. Be sure to work on side projects.**
