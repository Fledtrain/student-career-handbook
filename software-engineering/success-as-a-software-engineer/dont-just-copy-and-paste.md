When you are learning something, following a tutorial or guide, reading StackOverflow, or learning a new language:

* Don't just copy & paste. It's harder to make yourself stop and try to understand but worth it.
* When you're are learning a new concept, go through each section one time to start off
* Take notes and jot down thoughts or key parts 
* Then pause, digest, and try to recreate the example. See how far you can get without looking back. 
* Reread or rewatch the same material again, with a focus on what you missed last time
* At each stage, try to force yourself to understand why the code is working or not.
* Be mindful of where you have gaps in your understanding and write those down
* Then work to specifically fill in those gaps, this helps you retain knowledge better
* The more gaps you fill up over time this way, the more you will expand your knowledge
* Google around and check Stackoverflow to further build knowledge and close gaps
