The author hopes that applying some of these will make you stand out and accelerate your early career as a developer.

* **Always be learning**
  * Learning is considered a lifelong journey in this field
  * Read books and articles, take courses, and participate in workshops and hackathons
  * Sometimes, companies pay for you to do this, ask your manager about this
* **Don't assume existing code is untouchable**
  * Well-intentioned code can have anti-patterns in it, be hard to read, get stale over time, and it can create bugs. So go ahead and suggest a change to the code, it may need it.
* **If in doubt, underpromise and overdeliver**
  * Your goal should be to match and exceed expectations consistently
  * Best to consistently deliver on your goals and surprise people with your speed than to promise the moon but always be late.
* **Embrace the grunt work**
  * See a problem? Volunteer to help fix it. See an area of improvement? Say yes to working on it.
  * As a result of it, the product improves, the productivity and morale of those around you go up, you learn a new skill, and you gain the respect of others.
  * You can then use this goodwill and track record to work on more exciting things over time.
* **Code is social**
  * Review your teammates' code and learn from it. 
  * Don't just read it, but also comment on it and ask questions. Learn from how people write code.
* **Feedback = Improvement**
  * Explicitly ask for feedback from your manager and teammates.
  * Use this feedback to transform yourself continuously.
  * Remember that one of the best ways to learn is by doing the wrong thing, realizing why it's wrong, and then not doing it anymore. Rinse and repeat.
* **Take ownership of something**
  * Work with your manager to find something that can be yours. 
  * Working on a project of your own gives you a way to be unique, learn about all the stages of development, and cultivate accountability.
* **Look for the low-hanging fruits**
  * There are many small things in the codebase that you can do with your current skillset. 
  * Taking these on and showing off your skills right away is an excellent way to get noticed.
* **Be everywhere**
  * Show up every day to discuss problems, answer your teammates' questions, celebrate wins, and provide moral support when things go wrong.
  * You want others to think that you've been at the company for much longer.
* **Speak up**
  * It's a good idea to be humble in general, but you also want to communicate your thoughts, even if you lack experience. 
  * People like to see new people with different perspectives add to the conversation.
* **Rely on your manager**
  * Ask your manager to help you plan out your goals and to keep you accountable. They're there for you, use their time and support wisely.
* **Have fun**
  * You want to enjoy doing this because you'll likely be doing it for many years. Find projects that connect with you, work on problems that excite you.
* **Find informal mentors**
  * Have lunch, coffee with more experienced engineers, develop a rapport with them, and ask them questions you have.
