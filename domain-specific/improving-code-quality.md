# Improving Code Quality

When coding in an interview context or when presenting code on your Github profile, it’s important to spend some attention on the following:

* Basic code styling \(Spacing, indentation, braces, etc\)
* Variable/method naming \(prefix and spelling, clear naming\)
* Language conventions \(e.g., using list comprehensions in Python or async/await/promises in Javascript\)
* Object-Oriented Design \(encapsulation, scoping, class design, etc\)
* Understand how to easily unit test all of your code

## Common Checklist <a id="Common-Checklist"></a>

Be sure to look out for the following things:

* Try to make sure all whitespace and indentation is properly formatted and consistent throughout the code. Try using an “auto-indent” within your text editor or IDE for your language.
* A common coding style convention is that class names should be written in PascalCase and variable names should be written in camelCase
* Avoid any misspelled words in any methods, variables, comments, etc. This demonstrates an attention to detail in your code.
* Try to include at least a few comments in your code to explain intent on certain key code blocks.
* Make sure to include some reasonable code organization into objects, methods. Avoid long blocks of complicated unorganized code. The longer and more concentrated a function is, the more difficult it is to understand.
* Avoid deeply nesting code. The code is more readable as it’s easier for the eye to follow and the logic is less dense and pretzel-ed. 
* Code that you want to sustain should be tested. If you test your code properly, you will increase your ability to modify/scale your code safely.


## Style Guides <a id="Style-Guides"></a>

There are many great style guides online, you can check a few suggested language-specific ones below:

* [Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/)
* [Java for Android](https://medium.com/@aliesaassadi/android-java-style-guide-515d99d888a5)
* [Swift](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)

If you are working in a different language, you can often find them many of these as top results for `“[language] style guide”` on Google.
