This is an introduction to graphics programming, below you will find some suggestions, resources, frameworks, and a list of mentors who can help!

### Pick a Project <a id="Pick-a-Project"></a>

* Everyone is different with regards to how they learn. Often though, having a project and goal in mind can be very helpful. For example, “I’m going to build a particle system demo using Vulkan/C++”.
* Keep the project simple, especially at first. Focus on learning one technique and keep the rest of the work very easy. Don’t try to build a whole game at once. Build a lighting effect or a little fluid/particle sim, or a shader. Keep the scope limited.
* Focus your energy on relevant skills to developing that project or goal and ignore the rest at first. This is good because:
  * There’s too much to learn all at once
  * Focusing on skills you need to build things as opposed to theory is important
  * Building demos can help you get jobs more easily than anything else
* As you build a project or demo, post updates and post the source on Github. This can be a great way to meet people and get visibility for your work, get hired, etc. And you’ll help teach other beginners as well.
* Scanning the latest SIGGRAPH papers can give you an idea of what kind of work is interesting to graphics researchers.

### Find a Mentor! <a id="Find-a-Mentor"></a>

Stephanie [maintains a mentor list](http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2016/11/14/list-of-engineers-willing-to-mentor-you) with many graphics programmers. They all love helping others, so feel free to reach out to them!

### More Advanced <a id="More-Advanced"></a>

* [“A trip through the graphics pipeline” by @rygorous](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index/)

### Relation to Math <a id="Relation-to-Math"></a>

An important point: The vast majority of graphics coders don’t know math very well. Don’t be scared away if you aren’t a math person.
