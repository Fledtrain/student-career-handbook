# A Deeper Understanding of Java

If you never programmed at all before or if you are interested in starting with the basics, spend the first few months focused on learning Java. Learn the syntax and understand how everything works. You‚Äôll need to be able to create classes, create and call methods, use interfaces as well as know how inheritance works, before you can go to the next step. These are the basics of Java, and you‚Äôll use them extensively when developing Android apps.
