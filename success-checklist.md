![:warning:](https://codepath.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/warning.png) Note that no one is an expert at everything and no one will be able to complete 100% of the items below. It’s okay and normal that you won’t know everything, and that you won’t complete this entire checklist.

Take things one step at a time. Try to focus your learning and time around particular goals. There’s an enormous amount to learn and do, and it’s really easy to get overwhelmed.
